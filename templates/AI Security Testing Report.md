# 8. Conclusion

The security assessment identified **[number]** findings in **[AI application]**.

The most significant issue was **[finding]**, which could allow an attacker to **[impact]**.

The assessment demonstrates that AI applications should not rely solely on the model to enforce security controls. Authorization, access control, and validation should be implemented at the application layer.

A retest should be performed after remediation to confirm that the identified issues have been addressed.
