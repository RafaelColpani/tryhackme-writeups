## 3. Methodology

The assessment followed a simplified penetration testing process:

### 3.1 Reconnaissance

Information was collected about the target, including:

- Open ports
- Running services
- Technologies
- Web directories
- Subdomains
- Exposed files

**Tools:**

- Nmap
- Gobuster
- WhatWeb
- [Other tools]

### 3.2 Enumeration

The identified services were investigated to determine:

- Service versions
- Available endpoints
- Authentication mechanisms
- Exposed information
- Possible attack vectors

### 3.3 Exploitation

Identified vulnerabilities were tested to determine whether they were actually exploitable.

### 3.4 Post-Exploitation

Where applicable, post-exploitation activities were performed to determine:

- Access level obtained
- Sensitive information accessible
- Possibility of privilege escalation
- Potential lateral movement

### 3.5 Reporting

Evidence was collected through:

- Screenshots
- Commands
- HTTP requests/responses
- Logs
- Tool output
